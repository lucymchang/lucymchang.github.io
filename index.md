### I am a paleobiologist interested in what controls the shape of living things over time.

I am currently a Peter Buck Deep Time Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Smithsonian Institute National Museum of Natural History](http://naturalhistory.si.edu/). You can find an overview of my research interests, outreach activities, teaching, and more on this website.

I received my Ph.D. at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Charles Marshall](http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/marshall/) in the [Department of Integrative Biology](http://ib.berkeley.edu/) and [Museum of Paleontology](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/).  Before that, I received a B.S. in [Geophysical Sciences](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/) from the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) and worked as a web developer before pursuing an advanced degree in paleontology. I am fascinated by the intersection between science, technology, and communication and am passionate about making science accessible to everyone through inquiry and experience.

My unabridged C.V. can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WIl9_PZGPZ4RLKd_nXcQ2G1eKad0dv5wBGQ1mu0TxM4/pub).
