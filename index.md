### I am a paleobiologist interested in what controls the shape of living things over time.

I am currently a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Charles Marshall](http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/marshall/) in the [Department of Integrative Biology](http://ib.berkeley.edu/) and [Museum of Paleontology](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/). You can find an overview of my research interests, outreach activities, teaching, and more on this website.

I hold a B.S. in [Geophysical Sciences](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/) from the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) and worked as a web developer before entering graduate school to pursue paleontology. I am fascinated by the intersection between science, technology, and communication and am passionate about making science accessible to everyone through inquiry and experience.

My unabridged C.V. can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WIl9_PZGPZ4RLKd_nXcQ2G1eKad0dv5wBGQ1mu0TxM4/pub).
