Back in 2012, I had the pleasure of working with the National Park Service for 10 weeks up in [Denali National Park and Preserve](https://www.nps.gov/dena/), Alaska.  I was one of two Geoheritage Education Specialists selected through the Geological Society of America's [GeoCorps](http://www.geosociety.org/geocorps/) program.

For those of you who haven't had the opportunity to explore Denali, it's a national park larger than the area of Massachusetts and home to North America's tallest peak, Denali (formerly Mt. McKinley).  Despite its size, almost all visitors come through the park at one entrance to explore the mountains and alpine forest and glacial remnants (e.g. kettle lakes, moraines) along one 52-mile Park Road that runs east-west through the park.  I spent my time in Denali writing much of the content for a Geology Road Guide, so that visitors and interpretive staff alike can learn more about the forces that shaped the park's complex geology over the course of millions of years while traveling the Park Road.

This past summer, the final version of the Road Guide was released.  It captures much of the beauty the park holds, and I couldn't be more pleased with how it turned out.  You can access the Road Guide on the NPS website here ([pdf](https://www.nps.gov/dena/learn/nature/upload/Denali-Geology-Road-Guide.pdf)).
